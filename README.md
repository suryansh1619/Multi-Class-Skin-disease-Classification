## üîç Project Overview

This project leverages six powerful CNN architectures to predict skin disease types from lesion images. It incorporates advanced preprocessing including hair removal and contrast enhancement to improve classification accuracy.

The web application is built using **Streamlit** and provides a user-friendly interface to upload an image and view top-2 class predictions along with their probabilities for each model.

## üöÄ Demo

Upload an image and get real-time predictions from:

- ‚úÖ ConvNeXtSmall
- ‚úÖ DenseNet201
- ‚úÖ EfficientNetV2S
- ‚úÖ InceptionV3
- ‚úÖ ResNet50V2
- ‚úÖ Xception

Each model displays:

- üîπ Top-1 prediction class and confidence
- üîπ Top-2 prediction class and confidence

## üß† Models Used

These models were trained and fine-tuned on the **HAM10000** dataset. They classify images into one of the following **7 skin disease classes**:

| Label  | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| akiec  | Actinic keratoses                    |
| bcc    | Basal cell carcinoma                 |
| bkl    | Benign keratosis-like lesions        |
| df     | Dermatofibroma                       |
| mel    | Melanoma                             |
| nv     | Melanocytic nevi                     |
| vasc   | Vascular lesions                     |

## üìà Model Evaluation & Visualizations

Each model has been evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**
- **ROC-AUC Curve (One-vs-Rest, Macro Averaged)**
- **Precision-Recall Curve**
